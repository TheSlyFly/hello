      <p>Drag Queens have been around for 100 of years, unfortunately not always celebrated as they should be. They are not necessarily gay, most live dull and ordinary lives, until at night when they come out wearing bright colors, mimicking to famous tunes. ABBAs 'Dancing Queen' is, of course, a favorite.</p>
